# Native published-wheel drift advisory — design

**Status:** approved-in-scope (2026-07-05), pending spec review
**Context:** Project 1 (#1459, merged) reconciles host native-kernel references
against the *source* kernel (`lib.rs`). This is the one check Project 1 cannot do:
reconcile current-source host references against the **already-published**
`goldenmatch-native` PyPI wheel — the actual #688 republish-lag catcher. Related:
`project_688_stale_native_wheel`, `feedback_verify_perf_not_just_ship`,
`project_api_parity_gate`.

## 1. Problem (why this is not redundant with Project 1)

Project 1 proves the *source* is internally consistent: every host
`native_module().X` / `getattr(native, "X")` reference is a registered
`wrap_pyfunction!` export. It says nothing about what the **shipped wheel**
contains. #688 was exactly this gap: `build_exclude_set` landed in source (host +
kernel both updated, Project 1 would be green), but the published wheel `0.1.0`
predated it — so every `pip install goldenmatch[native]` user silently ran the
slow fallback for that symbol until the wheel was republished.

A build-from-source check (publish-time gate, or maturin-build-then-`dir()`) does
**not** catch this: a wheel built from source S always contains source S's
registered symbols, and the host refs are read from that same S — they are
consistent by construction. The skew #688 is about is strictly between
**current-source host refs** and an **older published wheel**. Only comparing
those two catches it.

## 2. Goal

An **advisory** CI job that:
1. reads the current-source host reference set (reusing Project 1's
   `scan_references`),
2. introspects the **published** `goldenmatch-native` wheel's actual Python-visible
   exports,
3. warns (does not hard-fail) when a host-referenced symbol is absent from the
   published wheel, with the remediation: **republish `goldenmatch-native`**.

**Advisory, not a gate — deliberately.** A hard gate would be a chicken-and-egg:
the PR that adds symbol X + its host dependency cannot also republish a wheel
containing X (the wheel is built from that PR's not-yet-merged code), so a blocking
check would make it unmergeable. And a lagging wheel *degrades gracefully* (slow
path, correct output), so blocking CI over it is disproportionate. The advisory
surfaces the lag as an annotation; a human republishes.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Reuse Project 1's scanner

Import `scan_references`, `REGISTRY`, and `load_allow` from
`scripts/check_native_symbols.py` (by path, as its own tests do). The host
reference set is computed identically — one source of truth for "what the host
depends on."

### 3.2 Wheel introspection — Python-visible exports, not `nm`

The published wheel ships a compiled abi3 module (`goldenmatch_native._native`).
Its Python-visible export names are the ones registered at runtime via
`m.add_function(...)` — **not** recoverable by `nm`/symbol-dump on the `.so` (that
yields mangled Rust/pyo3 wrapper symbols). The reliable way: `pip install
goldenmatch-native`, then `import goldenmatch_native._native as m` and read
`{name for name in dir(m) if not name.startswith("_") and callable(getattr(m, name))}`.
The CI job installs the **published** wheel (from PyPI, not a local build) so the
introspected set reflects what real users get.

### 3.3 The check

```
referenced = scan_references(goldenmatch host source)   # reused, Project 1
shipped    = wheel_exports("goldenmatch_native._native") # dir() of the installed wheel
lagging    = referenced - shipped - allow
```
- `lagging` non-empty → print an actionable warning listing each symbol and
  "the published goldenmatch-native (vX.Y.Z) lacks these; republish it". Exit 0
  (advisory) — or exit non-zero only under an explicit `--strict` used by a future
  release checklist, never on the scheduled run.
- Also print, informationally, `shipped - referenced` is NOT interesting here (the
  wheel may export more than the host uses — fine); only the `referenced - shipped`
  direction is the lag.

A `--module` flag selects the wheel module (default `goldenmatch_native._native`)
so the same script serves the other native wheels later. A per-package `allow`
(reuse `parity/native_symbols/<pkg>.allow`) covers a symbol deliberately allowed to
lag (e.g. one gated behind a not-yet-released feature).

### 3.4 Scope: goldenmatch first

Reference implementation on `goldenmatch` / `goldenmatch-native`, structured (the
`--module` + REGISTRY) so the other native wheels (`goldencheck-native`,
`goldenpipe-native`, `native-flow`, `analysis-native`) are a mechanical follow-on.

## 4. Testing

**Box-safe unit tests** (`scripts/test_native_wheel.py`): the reconcile logic and
`wheel_exports` are tested against a **stub module object** (a synthetic object with
attributes standing in for a compiled `_native`), so no real wheel/build is needed:
- `wheel_exports` filters to public callables (ignores `_private`, non-callables).
- the lag computation (`referenced - shipped - allow`) reports the right set.
- an empty lag prints "up to date" and exits 0.
- allow subtraction works.

The real published-wheel introspection is CI-only (needs the installed wheel).

## 5. CI

A new **scheduled + dispatchable** workflow `native-wheel-drift.yml`:
- `on: schedule` (weekly) + `workflow_dispatch`.
- Steps: checkout; `setup-python`; `pip install goldenmatch-native` (the published
  wheel); `python scripts/check_native_wheel.py goldenmatch`.
- Advisory posture: the job surfaces `::warning::` annotations and stays green (the
  script exits 0 on lag by default). A weekly cadence is enough — republish lag is
  a release-hygiene issue, not a per-PR one.

(Not wired into per-PR `ci.yml` — a source PR must never be blocked by the state of
the *previously* published wheel.)

## 6. Rollout / docs

- Single PR, branch `feat/native-wheel-drift` off `origin/main` (has #1459's
  script). Script + unit tests + the scheduled workflow.
- benzsevern gh; merge-queue → `gh pr merge --auto --squash` (no `--delete-branch`);
  arm auto-merge, stop.
- A one-line note in the native-kernel section of the relevant CLAUDE.md /
  docs that the advisory exists and its remediation is "republish goldenmatch-native"
  (reinforces the existing #688 lesson).

## 7. Risks

- **Published wheel unavailable / platform mismatch.** `pip install
  goldenmatch-native` on the linux CI runner must resolve an abi3 wheel importable
  by the runner's Python (abi3 ⇒ 3.11+; the wheel targets that). If the install or
  import fails, the job must fail LOUD (a silent skip would make the advisory
  falsely reassuring) — distinct exit for "couldn't introspect the wheel" vs
  "wheel is up to date".
- **Version drift is expected between releases.** The advisory will legitimately
  warn right after a source PR adds a symbol and before the next
  `goldenmatch-native` release — that is the intended signal, not noise. The
  warning names the fix (republish). It should not be escalated to a hard failure.
- **Reused scanner coupling.** If Project 1's `scan_references` signature changes,
  this script breaks — acceptable (they are the same subsystem and should evolve
  together); a shared unit-test import guards it.
